Certain features work but might not be optimally implemented check TODOs

Certain parts of the system are not that consistent, like certain tests

Feedback would also be very much appreciated and specifically the concrete domain model

It was fun to work on, but especially as a one-person group there was just a lot to do.

Since it is incredibly boring to write tests, it would have been great to have the tests already made and build the system around those.

Then we can focus on the new DDD theory and still follow the TDD by already having the failing tests first.
